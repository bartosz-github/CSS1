        <h3>Lapsang Souchong</h2>

        Distinctively smoky, subtly sweet.
        Lapsang Souchong is a traditional Chinese tea, originated in the Wuyi Mountains in the Fujian region of China, renowned among tea connoisseurs and said to be the place where black tea was invented.

        Unlike other teas, which use the first leaves of a bud, Lapsang is crafted using the larger fourth and fifth leaves on each bud, benefiting from the slightly different chemical composition of these more mature leaves.

        <ol>
            <li>To enjoy this tea at its best, always warm the teapot first with boiling water.</li>

            <li>Serve with or without milk.</li>
        </ol>

        The tea leaves are then dried in bamboo baskets above a pinewood fire, allowing the leaves to absorb the smoke during the drying process. It is the smoke treatment of the tea leaves that gives Lapsang Souchong its unique earthy fragrance.
        Finally the tea is oxidised and then the tea leaves are twisted and rolled.
        Although the Chinese pronunciation is different, the English pronunciation of Lapsang Souchong is “lop song soo shong”.



        <h3>Oolong Tea</h2>
<!-- https://yiheteas.com/how-to-make-oolong-tea/ -->
 <!-- https://www.wikihow.life/Prepare-Oolong-Tea -->
        Oolong is a traditional Chinese tea (Camellia sinensis) produced through a unique process including withering the plant 
        under the strong sun and oxidation before curling and twisting. The name oolong tea came into the English language from 
        the Chinese name, meaning "black dragon".
        In Chinese tea culture, semi-oxidised Oolong teas are collectively grouped as qīngchá. The taste of oolong varies widely 
        among different subvarieties. It can be sweet and fruity with honey aromas, or woody and thick with roasted aromas, 
        or green and fresh with bouquet aromas, all depending on the horticulture and style of production. Several subvarieties of oolong, including those produced in the Wuyi Mountainsof northern Fujian, such as Da Hong Pao, are among the most famous Chinese teas.
        Different varieties of oolong are processed differently, but the leaves are formed into one of two distinct styles. 
        Some are rolled into long curly leaves, while others are 'wrap-curled' into small beads, each with a tail. 
        The former style is the more traditional of the two in China.
        <br>
        Oolong is not a black tea; it is a distinct type of tea that is partially oxidized, falling between green and black 
        tea in terms of oxidation levels and flavor. While both oolong and black tea come from the same plant, Camellia sinensis, 
        their processing methods and resulting characteristics differ significantly.
